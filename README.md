# calc
    Create a calc package containing a non-exportable calculator structure. Write an exportable constructor function to create an instance of the calculator structure.
        Add an exportable (public) Calculate method for the calculator structure. The method should accept 2 numbers of float64 type and a string operator (+, -, *, /) as parameters. The method must return a value of float64 type.
        Add non-exported (private) methods for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Each private method must take 2 numbers of type float64 as input and return a value of type float64. (The method for dividing numbers must check the divisor to be equal to 0).
